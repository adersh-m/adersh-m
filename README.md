# üëã Hi, I'm Adersh M!  
### üéØ Full-Stack Developer | üõ†Ô∏è Problem Solver | üß† Learning in Public

I'm a passionate full-stack developer with over 10 years of experience in crafting scalable, efficient, and innovative software solutions. I've worked across industries like insurance, shipping, and Microsoft consulting, which has shaped my approach to solving complex challenges with practical, high-impact systems.

I thrive on problem-solving, mentoring, and building systems that make a real difference. Collaboration and continuous learning drive me ‚Äî currently I'm exploring technologies like React, Angular, .NET Core, and diving into the world of Generative AI.

I'm now building a **public portfolio** to stay focused, share my learning journey, and showcase real-world, thoughtful projects ‚Äî one step at a time. Each project is a mix of curiosity, persistence, and a bit of storytelling.
