# 👋 Hi, I'm Adersh M!  
### 🚀 Full-Stack Developer | Consultant | Mentor | Problem Solver  

I’m a passionate **full-stack developer** with over **10 years of experience** in crafting scalable, efficient, and innovative software solutions. Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to work in diverse industries like **insurance**, **shipping**, and **Microsoft consulting**, which has shaped my approach to solving complex technical challenges.

I thrive on **problem-solving** and enjoy the process of building systems that truly make an impact. Mentoring fellow developers and guiding them through challenges has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my career, and I strongly believe in the power of **collaboration**.

I'm constantly learning and evolving, currently diving into technologies like **React**, **Angular**, and **.NET Core**, and exploring exciting areas like **Generative AI**.  

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me diving deep into new tech, solving puzzles, or sharing insights with other developers. If you're interested in working together or just want to connect, feel free to reach out!
